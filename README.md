# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the project

Since the project is still local, the "PostgreSQL" program must be installed on the computer to work with the database. A database named "treeTreatment" should be created in this database.
In the "backend" folder, you need to write "npm i" to install dependencies. then write "npm run dev" to start the server.
Also, in the "frontend" folder, you need to write "npm i", and then the "npm start" command to start the client.
